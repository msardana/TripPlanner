/**
 *  Program to implementing a fractional knapsack problem
 *  
 *  In this problem we have a Knapsack that has a weight limit W.
 *  There are items i1, i2, ..., in each having weight w1, w2, â€¦ wn and some benefit (value or profit) associated with it v1, v2,.., vn.
 *  Our objective is to maximize the benefit such that the total weight inside the knapsack is at most W
 *  And we are also allowed to take an item in fractional part
