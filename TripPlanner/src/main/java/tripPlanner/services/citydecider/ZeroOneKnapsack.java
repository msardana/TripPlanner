/**
 *  Program to implementing a 0/1 knapsack problem
 *  
 *  Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W 
 *  to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words,
 *  given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights
 *  associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
 *  find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is 
 *  smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, 
 *  or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
